Workflow :
 check a file, AC-23.rb for instance, evaluate the puppet script, look at resources like files or templates, in the original clip puppet directory structure. implement in chef syntax. update INCOMPLETE.
 this is just something i thought would be useful as it concerns a lot of files that were programmatically created, after they have been implemented in chef this file can be removed.
